<p>My final project proposal is a stuffed animal that helps with emotional validation as a means of catharsis. Using a knob, the user is able to twist it to a corresponding emotion. The stuffed animal responds that it is okay to feel that way, mimicking the emotion. If the user is sad, the stuffed animal slumps down and has sad eyes. Afterwards, it offers advice about what to do to combat negative feelings. Seeing their emotions mirrored can help users feel that their emotions are valid and would hopefully be able to move past negative emotions more easily.</p>
