<p><b>Update 24 Feb: </b>I changed my idea for my final project as I found out that it was too close to my capstone project.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a commuter, I take the bus and light rail almost daily. I spend approximately 1.5 hours to get to campus in the morning, 40 minutes walking and light-railing to work (and another 30 going back from work to campus, and 1.25 hours to get home. Considering how I'm spending approximately 4 hours each day just getting from one place to another, I've grown fascinated and passionate about the Great Seattle Area's public transit system.</p>
 
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>This new final project concept is a bus plushie so that I can feel connected to Community Transit  even when I'm home because I just can't get enough of commuting (/s). It features an LCD screen on the front that displays various messages, just as we see on real-life buses that list their route number on the front. In this version, we will have a set number of pre-determined messages on the screen. It can be remote controlled such that we can choose the message using the remote.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>LCD screen</li>
<li>Felt, sewing thread, foam for filling</li>
<li>Remote</li>
<li>Receiver</li>

</ul>
