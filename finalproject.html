            <h1>Reine's Final Project: Bus Buddy</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a commuter, I take the bus and light rail almost daily. I spend approximately 1.5 hours to get to campus in the morning, 40 minutes walking and light-railing to work (and another 30 going back from work to campus, and 1.25 hours to get home. Considering how I'm spending approximately 4 hours each day just getting from one place to another, I've grown fascinated and passionate about the Greater Seattle Area's public transit system.</p>
 
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>This new final project concept is a bus plushie so that I can feel connected to Community Transit  even when I'm home because I just can't get enough of commuting (/s). It features an LCD screen on the front that displays various messages, just as we see on real-life buses that list their route number on the front. In this version, we will be using the WSDOT API to find out how long it will take me to get to Seattle from my home (the Everett-Seattle travel time). This information will be displayed on the LCD screen.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>LCD screen</li>
<li>Felt, sewing thread, foam for filling</li>
<li>Wires + wires w/ male and female ends</li>
<li>Potentiometer</li>
<li>Small breadboard</li>
</ul>

<h1>Technical Implementation</h1>

<h2>Circuit</h2>
<img src="lcdcircuit.png" width = 500>
<p>The system is quite simple as most of the work was in the code. This image was borrowed from circuitbasics.com</p>

<h2>Schematic</h2>
<img src="busschematic.jpg" width = 500>
<p>The display is composed of an LCD screen as an output and the potentiometer as an input (to set the backlight brightness.)</p>

<h2>Making the Bus</h2> 
<img src="bussketch.jpg" width = 500>
<p>I created sewing plans for the bus such that it would have a slot to store the electronic materials. I wanted it to be easy to remove in the event that I would want to wash Bus Buddy. </p>

<img src="busbuddy.JPG" width = 500>
<p>I used different colored felts to give it that classic Community Transit look, sewing in appliqu√©s for the face, windows, and wheels.</p>
<img src="buswitharduino.JPG" width = 500>
<p>The Arduino is enclosed at the top of the bus, covered by the roof, which is a simple felt flap.</p>

<h2>From Python to Arduino</h2>
<p>I wrote python code to get data from the WSDOT API, which prints onto serial as bytes. Arduino code then reads that information, converts it into a string, and prints it out on the LCD screen. As the API frequently refreshes the traffic time, the code calls for the API data every 10 seconds and updates the display.</p>

<p>You can see how everything works together in the following video:

// This Arduino code takes the information printed by the corresponding python file 
// and prints it onto the LCD screen

  byte ndx = 0;        // the index position for storing the character
    
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {

    // runs when there is information available in the serial monitor
    // keep going until buffer is empty
    while (Serial.available() > 0) { 
      if (ndx > maxChars - 1) { // -1 because arrays count from 0
        ndx = maxChars;     // extra chars are dumped into last array element, overwritten by terminator
      }                                                 
      inputSeveral[ndx] = Serial.read();
      ndx ++;

    }

    // makes sure the terminator is not written beyond the array
    if (ndx > maxChars) {  
       ndx = maxChars;
    }

    // add a zero terminator to mark the end of the string
    inputSeveral[ndx] = 0; 
    }

    // prints the series of characters (string) to serial (to check the information
    Serial.print(inputSeveral);
    Serial.println(" min from Everett to Seattle");

// Prints information to the LCD display
void printDisplay(){

  lcd.setCursor(0,0);
