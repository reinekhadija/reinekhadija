// This program allows the user to control a servo motor
// using a joystick. 

#include < Servo.h >

const int servoPin = 9;   // Input pin that servo motor is attached to
const int joystickX = A0; // Analog input pin that reads joystick X value
const int joystickY = A1; // Analog input pin that reads joystick Y value
int xval = 0;             // Measured X value of joystick
int yval = 0;             // Measured Y value of joystick

Servo myServo;            // Creates servo object


// Initializes once the board is reset
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);       // Initializes serial communications at 9600 bps
  myServo.attach(servoPin); // Attaches servo to its corresponding pin
}

void loop() {
  xval = analogRead(joystickX);   // Reads joystick X value from input pin
  yval = analogRead(joystickY);   // Reads joystick Y value from input pin

  // Determines how the joystick orientation will turn the servo motor
 
  if (xval == 0 && yval < 600) {
    // If the joystick is facing down, the motor will spin the full 180 degrees
    myServo.write(180);
    
  } else if (xval > 400 && yval > 500) { 
    // If the joystick is facing left, the motor spins 90 degrees
    myServo.write(90);
    
  } else if (xval > 600 && yval < 600) { 
    // If the joystick is facing up, the motor will spin up at 0 degrees
    myServo.write(0);
  }

	<h2>Circuit</h2>            
   	<img src="motorscircuit.jpg" width = 400>
<p>The circuit is composed of one joystick and a servo motor. The joystick orientation controls the angle which the servo motor rotates. </p>

	<h2>Schematic</h2>

<p>
This was planned by figuring out which values of x and y correspond to which joystick orientation. Once I was able to determine what these values were, I figured out which degree value of the servo motor they should correspond to. This was dependent on how the joystick and motor were arranged on my table. I had mapped it out on two axes and chose values for which the joystick would be pointed up/down/left. 
</p>

<h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
<img src="a5motors.gif" width=400>
<p> It is coded such that if the joystick is pushed up, the motor is at 0 degrees; if the joystick is pushed to the left, the motor propeller faces left at 90 degrees; and if the joystick is pushed down, the motor spins 180 degrees.</p>
