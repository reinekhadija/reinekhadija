	   <h2>Code Snippet</h2>

		<code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT); // initialize Pin 7 as an output
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT); // initialize Pin 9 as an output
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // initialize Pin 11 as an output
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // initialize Pin 13 as an output
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  // green LED are assigned to Pins 7 and 9 and should blink in succession one time each
  for (int greenPin = 7; greenPin < 10; greenPin +=2){
    digitalWrite(greenPin, HIGH); // a green LED lights up as it's connected to the Pin
    delay(500);                   // a half-second delay
    digitalWrite(greenPin,LOW);   // a green LED turns off as it's connected to the Pin
  }

  // red pins are assigned to Pins 11 and 13 and should blink two times each
  for (int redPin = 11; redPin < 14; redPin +=2){
    digitalWrite(redPin,HIGH);    // a red LED lights up as it's connected to the Pin
    delay(300);                   // a 300ms delay
    digitalWrite(redPin,LOW);     // a red LED turns off as it's connected to the Pin
    delay(300);                   // a 300ms delay
    digitalWrite(redPin,HIGH);    // the same red LED lights up as it's connected to the Pin
    delay(300);                   // a 300ms delay
    digitalWrite(redPin,LOW);     // the same red LED turns off as it's connected to the Pin
  }
 }

<h2>Circuit </h2>
<img src="blinkcircuit.jpg" width=400>
<p>The circuit is composed of four LED lights: two green and two red that are connected to Pins 7, 9, 11, and 13 respectively.</p>
<h2>Schematic</h2>
<img src="a1schematic.jpg" width=400>
<p>For red and green LEDs, there is a 1.8V drop and a 20mA desired current.
<br/>
<code>
V = 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V
V = I X R
3.2V = 0.02A x R 
R = 3.2V / 0.02A
R = 160 ohms
</code>
<br/>
For the ideal current of 20mA, the resistor should be 160 ohms. In the available kit, resistors of 220 and 330 ohms would suffice, but I chose 1K as it allows the LED to shine brightly enough and is a safe value to make sure that the LED does not burn out. 
</p>
<h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
<img src="circuit.gif" width=400>
<p>Green LEDs are programmed to blink once, while red LEDs blink twice in succession. This makes for an interesting pattern.</p>
